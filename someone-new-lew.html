    />Meet Lewis Whitten</h2>

    <p>
        Lewis “Lew” Whitten’s story is one of persistence, work, reinvention, and deep commitment to the people of Nevada.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lew grew up in the Chicago suburbs, where he was a Special Education student in high school. 
        He understands firsthand the challenges that students face when the system isn’t built to support them — 
        because he lived it. That early experience shaped his lifelong belief that every Nevadan deserves a chance 
        to succeed, no matter their background.
    </p>

    <p>
        After graduating high school, Lew earned his first degree from 
        <strong>Southern Illinois University</strong>. Years later, he went on to earn a 
        <strong>Master’s Degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas</strong>, adding formal training to the real-world experience 
        he built along the way.
    </p>

    <h3>Work, Leadership, and Real-World Experience</h3>

    <p>
        In the 1990s, Lew worked on the Las Vegas Strip as a <strong>table games dealer</strong>, gaining an inside 
        understanding of Nevada’s tourism economy, the people who keep it running, and the pressures they face every day.
        After dealing, he spent over two decades as an <strong>entrepreneur</strong>, starting and running his own businesses 
        through good times and hard times. That experience shaped his respect for small-business owners, working families, 
        and the importance of economic freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Lew serves Nevada as a <strong>Special Education Teacher</strong>, working with students who need support, structure, 
        and someone who actually cares. Having once been a Special Education student himself, this role is more than a job — 
        it is a full-circle mission.
    </p>

    <h3>A Steady Voice for Nevada</h3>

    <p>
        Lew has put his name on the ballot three times for the Nevada State Assembly, always running on principle, 
        independence, and the belief that Nevadans deserve honesty and transparency from their elected officials.
    </p>

    <p>
        After his 2006 Assembly race, Lew publicly announced his intention to run for Governor of Nevada in 2026. 
        He made that announcement early and intentionally — to allow time to focus on raising his family, 
        strengthening his community, and understanding the challenges that Nevada would face during a time of global transition.
    </p>

    <p>
        That time is now. With the United Nations’ <strong>Agenda 2030</strong> set to reshape the world’s political and economic 
        landscape, Lew believes Nevada must navigate the upcoming transition peacefully, wisely, and with the people’s 
        interests at heart — not the interests of bureaucrats or party insiders.
    </p>
